### LaunchDarkly Sample React Native Application

We've built a simple application that demonstrates how LaunchDarkly's SDK works. Below, you'll find the basic build procedure, but for more comprehensive instructions, you can visit your [Quickstart page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/quickstart#/).

##### Build instructions
1. Open the `hello-react-native` directory
2. Copy the mobile key from your account settings page from your LaunchDarkly dashboard into `App.js`.
3. Run `yarn install && yarn upgrade` to download the dependencies for the application.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the server to deliver the bundle url. Make sure this is running before you start your application. 

##### iOS specific build instructions
1. Run your application through the Simulator or on a real device.
